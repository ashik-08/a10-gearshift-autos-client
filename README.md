# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Project Name
- GearShift Autos

## Live Website
- https://a10-gearshift-autos.web.app/

## 5 key points of GearShift Autos website:

1. **Multi-Brand Automotive Showcase:** The website serves as a comprehensive platform showcasing various car brands, with detailed information on each car, including images, prices, types, rating and descriptions. Users can explore a wide range of vehicles from different manufacturers.

2. **User-Friendly Authentication:** The website integrates Firebase authentication, allowing users to create accounts and access personalized features. Private routes ensure that only registered users can access certain functionalities, enhancing security and customization.

3. **Personalized Shopping Experience:** Registered users can create and manage their own shopping carts, enabling them to add and remove items. This personalization ensures that users only see their added cars, enhancing the shopping experience.

4. **Database Integration with MongoDB:** The project leverages MongoDB as the backend database, handling data retrieval, creation, deletion, and updates for brands, cars and user-cart. This seamless integration ensures data consistency and reliability.

5. **Efficient Deployment and Hosting:** The server-side is deployed on Vercel, a popular hosting platform, while the client-side is hosted on Firebase. This approach optimizes performance and scalability, allowing users to access the website and its features with ease.
